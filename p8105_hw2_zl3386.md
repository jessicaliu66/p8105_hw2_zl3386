## Problem 1

This problem uses the *FiveThirtyEight* data.

In particular, we’ll use the data in `pols-month.csv`,
`unemployment.csv`, and `snp.csv`.

Our goal is to merge these into a single data frame using `year` and
`month` as keys across datasets.

**First**, clean the data in `pols-month.csv`.

- Use `separate()` to break up the variable `mon` into integer variables
  `year`, `month`, and `day`
- Replace month number with month name
- Create a `president` variable taking values `gop` and `dem`, and
  remove `prez_dem` and `prez_gop`
- Remove the `day` variable.

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    president = case_match(
      prez_dem,
      1 ~ "dem",
      2 ~ "dem",
      0 ~ "gop"
    ),
    month = case_match(
      month,
      1 ~ "Jan",
      2 ~ "Feb",
      3 ~ "Mar",
      4 ~ "Apr",
      5 ~ "May",
      6 ~ "Jun",
      7 ~ "Jul",
      8 ~ "Aug",
      9 ~ "Sep",
      10 ~ "Oct",
      11 ~ "Nov",
      12 ~ "Dec"
    )
  ) |>
  select(-starts_with("prez_"), -day)
```

**Second**, clean the data in `snp.csv` using a similar process to the
above.

For consistency across datasets, arrange according to `year` and
`month`, and organize so that `year` and `month` are the leading
columns.

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() 

snp_df_1 = 
  snp_df[1:175,] |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) 

snp_df_2 = 
  snp_df[176:787,] |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day" ,"year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) |>
  relocate(year, month) |>
  mutate(
    year = year + 1900,
    year = replace(year, year == 1900, 2000)
  )

snp_df = 
  rbind(snp_df_1, snp_df_2) |>
  mutate(
    month = case_match(
      month,
      1 ~ "Jan",
      2 ~ "Feb",
      3 ~ "Mar",
      4 ~ "Apr",
      5 ~ "May",
      6 ~ "Jun",
      7 ~ "Jul",
      8 ~ "Aug",
      9 ~ "Sep",
      10 ~ "Oct",
      11 ~ "Nov",
      12 ~ "Dec"
    )
  ) |>
  select(-day) |>
  arrange(year, month)
```

**Third**, tidy the `unemployment` data so that it can be merged with
the previous datasets.

This process will involve switching from “wide” to “long” format;
ensuring that key variables have the same name; and ensuring that key
variables take the same values.

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_rate"
  ) |>
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

Join the datasets by merging `snp` into `pols`, and merging
`unemployment` into the result.

``` r
results_df =
  full_join(snp_df, pols_df, by = c("year", "month")) |>
  full_join(unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

- Dataset `pols_df` contains the date (`year` and `month`) , the party
  of the president (`president`) and the number of national politicians
  who are democratic or republican on the given date.

- Dataset `snp_df` contains 3 columns which indicate the date (`year`
  and `month`) and the closing values of the S&P stock index on the
  associated date (`close`).

- Dataset `unemployment_df` contains 3 columns which indicate the date
  (`year` and `month`) and the corresponding percentage of unemployment
  (`unemployment_rate`).

## Problem 2

This problem uses the *Mr. Trash Wheel* dataset.

Read and clean the *Mr. Trash Wheel* sheet:

- specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
  with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
  `read_excel`

- use reasonable variable names

- omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data

``` r
mr_df =
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
    sheet = 1,
    range = "A2:N586"
  ) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year)
  )
```

The data include a column for the (approximate) number of homes powered.
This calculation is described in the `Homes powered note`, but not
applied to every row in the dataset. Update the data to include a new
`homes_powered` variable based on this calculation.

``` r
mr_df =
  mutate(
    mr_df,
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30
  )
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
*Professor Trash Wheel* and *Gwynnda*, and combine these with the
*Mr. Trash Wheel* dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep
track of which Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an additional
variable to all datasets before combining.

``` r
prof_df =
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:M108"
  ) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30,
    wheel_name = "prof"
  )

gwyn_df =
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
    sheet = 4,
    range = "A2:L157"
  ) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30,
    wheel_name = "gwyn"
  )

mr_df =
  mutate(
    mr_df,
    wheel_name = "mr"
  )
```

``` r
trash_wheel_df =
  bind_rows(mr_df, prof_df, gwyn_df)
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables.

- The `trash_wheel_df` combines 3 datasets, with 584 observations from
  the *Mr. Trash Wheel* dataset, 106 observations from the *Professor
  Trash Wheel* dataset, and 155 observations from the *Gwynnda Trash
  Wheel* dataset.

- Each observation contains the date (`month`, `year` and `date`) and
  the corresponding trash collecting records of the trash wheel, such as
  the weight of trash (`weight_tons`), the volume of trash
  (`volume_cubic_yards`) and the number of specific types of trash
  (e.g. `plastic_bottles`, `cigarette_butts`).

For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by
Professor Trash Wheel?

- The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26
  (tons).

What was the total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in
July of 2021?

- The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of
  2021 is 1.63^{4}.
